            Happy Birthday! On this special day, I find myself compelled to
            express feelings that I&apos;ve kept hidden for far too long.
            It&apos;s been two beautiful years since I first stepped into our
            workplace, and on that very day, you left an indelible impression. I
            can vividly recall the vibrant yellow chudi, the red shaal, and that
            striking red lipstick that defined your elegance. Since that
            momentous day, a simple truth has lingered in my heart â€“ that you
            are exceptionally beautiful. Despite numerous attempts, my fear has
            always stifled my words, preventing me from expressing what I feel.
            In the quiet moments, I&apos;ve desperately wanted to convey my
            admiration. I&apos;ve tried many times to talk, but my fear has been
            an unyielding adversary. Yet, here I am, breaking free from the
            constraints of silence on your special day, a day that holds
            profound significance to me. Happy birthday to you, the radiant soul
            who has become a source of inspiration and admiration in my life.
            May this day bring you joy and warmth, just as your presence has
            illuminated my world. Here&apos;s to you, and the hope that this
            year allows us the chance to connect in ways words have failed to
            convey.
          </p>
          <div className="signature-sec">
            <p className="txt-pharmacy">Warmest wishes,</p>
